   <h1> Menu</h1>

    <h3>Fall 2015</h3>

    Our menu! is prepared daily from fresh, local flavors. Our menu is shasonal, meaning it changes according to
        availability of ingredients. This means we never pay for out of season items, and the good flavor and savings that
        result can be passed on directly to you. Below you can see a sampling of some of our customer's favorite dishes.
        Specials vary daily and are posted out front, or you may call to find out ahead of time at 1.555.678.9876.
